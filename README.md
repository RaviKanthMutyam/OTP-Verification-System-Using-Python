Objective: To develop a secure and user-friendly OTP verification system that authenticates
users via a One-Time Password sent to their email. The system ensures access is granted only
upon successful OTP validation, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.


Result: with the implementation of an OTP verification system that generates a 6- digit OTP,
sends it via email, and verifies user input through a GUI interface. Users have up to 3 attempts
within a 10-minute expiration period to correctly enter the OTP.
